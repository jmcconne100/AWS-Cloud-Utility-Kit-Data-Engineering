## AWS Data Engineering Toolkit (Meta Repo)

This is a curated **meta-repo** that links to a suite of modular tools and reusable components designed for **cloud-native data engineering on AWS**.

Each sub-repo serves a focused purpose â€” from infrastructure-as-code and admin automation to ETL support, reusable algorithms, and real-world deployment patterns. Together, they form a practical and extensible **AWS Data Engineering Toolkit**.
- **Patterns**: Implementation of 10 cloud-native architecture patterns using AWS services and Python.
- **CLI Tool**: Automates common admin tasks (monitoring, observability, cost-management).
- **Scripts and Algorithms**: Common algorithmic problems, basic problems, and ETL scripts with PySpark and Pandas.
- **CloudFormation Templates**: Reusable IaC resources for common setups in data and analytics pipelines.

This project is actively maintained as a living portfolio to explore cloud-native data engineering practices.

## Why This Toolkit?

Modern AWS data engineering involves far more than just writing pipelines â€” it includes managing infrastructure, automating workflows, deploying at scale, and monitoring behavior across systems.

This toolkit was created to:
- Accelerate new data engineering projects
- Provide production-aware, reusable components
- Showcase real-world AWS data workflows in modular form

---

## Recommended Use Cases

- âœ… Rapidly spin up AWS Glue, Redshift, or Athena environments
- âœ… Trigger and monitor jobs from the command line
- âœ… Automate IAM + resource provisioning using proven patterns
- âœ… Plug reusable ETL logic into new workflows
- âœ… Use patterns as templates for your own IaC deployments
